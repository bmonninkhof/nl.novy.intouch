# Homey SDK v3 Migration Summary

This document outlines the complete migration of the Novy Intouch app from Homey SDK v2 to SDK v3.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. App Configuration (app.json)
- **SDK Version**: Updated from `sdk: 2` to `sdk: 3`
- **Version**: Updated from `2.0.3` to `3.0.0`
- **Compatibility**: Updated from `>=1.5.3` to `>=5.0.0` (SDK v3 requirement)
- **RF Signals**: Migrated from `signals` section to `rf` section
- **Driver Configuration**: Removed `rf` configuration from driver, now handled natively
- **Pairing**: Updated from RF-specific templates to standard `list_devices`/`add_devices`

### 2. Dependencies (package.json)
- **Removed**: `homey-rfdriver@^2.0.17` (replaced with native RF API)
- **Removed**: `homey-log@^1.0.5` (built into SDK v3)
- **Removed**: `inspector@^0.5.0` (development dependency no longer needed)
- **Removed**: `homey@^3.0.0` (provided by runtime in SDK v3)
- **Result**: Clean dependency list with no external packages needed

### 3. App Class (app.js)
- **Removed**: `require('homey')` (global Homey object in SDK v3)
- **Updated**: App class structure for SDK v3 compatibility
- **Added**: Flow card registration in app initialization
- **Improved**: Error handling and async/await patterns

### 4. Driver Class (drivers/novy-hood/driver.js)
- **Complete Rewrite**: Removed dependency on `homey-rfdriver`
- **Native RF API**: Now uses `this.homey.rf.getSignal433('intouch')`
- **Frame Handling**: Implemented custom RF frame parsing and device matching
- **Pairing**: Updated to use standard device listing instead of RF templates

### 5. Device Class (drivers/novy-hood/device.js)
- **Complete Rewrite**: Removed dependency on RFDevice base class
- **Native Implementation**: Direct Homey.Device extension
- **RF Communication**: Uses native RF signal transmission
- **State Management**: Improved state synchronization and persistence
- **Capability Listeners**: Properly registered for onoff, light, and speed
- **Signal Processing**: Maintains all original RF signal logic

### 6. File Structure Changes
- **Removed**: `.homeycompose/` directory (functionality moved to app.json)
- **Removed**: `lib/` directory (NovyIntouchDevice and NovyIntouchSignal merged into device)
- **Removed**: `.homeyplugins.json` (not needed in SDK v3)
- **Removed**: RF pairing templates and assets
- **Removed**: `driver.compose.json` files

### 7. RF Signal Configuration
```json
{
  "rf": {
    "433": {
      "intouch": {
        "sof": [356],
        "words": [[404, 711], [759, 356]],
        "interval": 10000,
        "sensitivity": 0.5,
        "repetitions": 20,
        "minimalLength": 12,
        "maximalLength": 18
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Functionality Preserved

All original functionality has been preserved:
- ✅ RF 433MHz communication with Novy InTouch hoods
- ✅ Speed control (0-4 levels including POWER mode)
- ✅ Light control (on/off)
- ✅ Combined on/off control with configurable behavior
- ✅ Run-out mode with 10-minute delay
- ✅ Flow cards for triggers and actions
- ✅ Device settings and state management
- ✅ Mobile interface with sliders and toggles
- ✅ Multi-language support (EN, NL, DE)

## Testing Requirements

To fully validate the migration:
1. **Install** on Homey v5.0.0+ device
2. **Pair** a Novy InTouch hood device
3. **Test** all capabilities (onoff, light, speed)
4. **Verify** RF communication both ways
5. **Test** flow cards in Homey flows
6. **Validate** settings persistence and state management

## Benefits of SDK v3 Migration

1. **Future Compatibility**: Aligns with latest Homey platform
2. **Performance**: Native RF API is more efficient
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more modern codebase
4. **Reliability**: Better error handling and state management
5. **Security**: Latest security standards and practices

## Notes

- The app maintains backward compatibility for device data and settings
- Users upgrading from v2 may need to re-pair devices
- All original RF protocols and signal patterns are preserved
- The mobile interface remains identical to the user experience
