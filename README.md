### Settings
The app allows you to control the following device settings:
- `On/off` action: `hood & light` | `light only` | `hood only`
- `Run-out` mode: `enabled`/`disabled`
- `Light` state: `on/off` (*see explanation below*)
- `Speed level`: Current motor speed level (*see explanation below*)

### Flow support

*Commands*

- Device: `on`, `off`, `toggle` & `off with run-out mode` (10 min.)
- Light: `on`, `off` & `toggle` 
- Motor speed: `increase`, `decrease`, `off`, `level 1`, `level 2`, `level 3`, `POWER level`

*Triggers*  
There are triggers defined for all the above commands

*Conditions*  
No conditions defined yet (*coming soon...*)

*Actions*  
There are actions defined for all the above commands

### Internal state
**Important:** Novy Intouch does not specify separate signals for `on` and `off` actions (only a `toggle` signal is available).
Therefore Homey has to keep an internal `state` for `on/off`, `light` & `motor speed level`. This internal `state` is used to be able to send separate commands for `on`, `off` & `speed level`.  

The internal `state` is *updated* on:
1. Pressing buttons on the Novy Intouch remote (Homey receives a *signal*).
2. Triggers from the app (*Mobile card*)
3. Flow triggers & actions
4. Manual override via Settings

The internal `state` is **NOT** updated when:
1. Pressing buttons on the device (i.e. hood)
2. Remote signal is not detected
3. Device safety measures (e.g. overheating)
4. Timeouts (for now...*to be implemented*)
5. Other unknown reasons...

### TODO
- Support additional signals
- Create standalone light device
- Flow conditions
- Keep track of `Auto-Stop` timeout (security measure, hood (not light) is turned off after 3 hours of inactivity)
- Keep track of `POWER level` timeout => reduced to speed level 3 after 6 minutes
- Setting to override `run out` timeout (< 10 minutes)
- Setting to override `auto-stop` timeout (< 3 hours)
- Setting to override `power` timeout (<6 minutes)
- Handle `light` dimming (continuous press)
- Create separate device for the Intouch Remote
